# BeeAi OS – Vision

BeeAi OS explores how early-stage infrastructure decisions can be translated into 
structured, AI-compatible reasoning layers.

The goal is to create a deterministic foundation for decisions involving:
- planning,
- permitting,
- feasibility,
- cost–time–risk.

This repository documents the conceptual kernel only.
Future modules (stakeholders, BIM-tokenization, data ingestion, procurement adapters)
are intentionally excluded.

BeeAi OS is not a product.
It is a framework for thinking.

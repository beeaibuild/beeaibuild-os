# Cost–Time–Risk Engine – BeeAi OS

The Cost–Time–Risk (CTR) Engine is the reasoning core of BeeAi OS.  
It provides deterministic, reusable patterns for early-stage assessment where  
uncertainty is high and data availability is limited.

The CTR Engine does **not** aim to produce exact predictions.  
Its purpose is to structure fragmented domain inputs into  
**explainable reasoning chains** that support consistent decisions.

---

## 1. Purpose of the CTR Engine

- organize early-stage information  
- expose assumptions and uncertainty explicitly  
- generate structured cost–time–risk envelopes  
- identify constraints and dependencies  
- support feasibility and scenario thinking  
- provide transparent reasoning paths suitable for public-sector use

The engine functions as a **logic layer**, not a forecasting model.

---

## 2. Input Types

The CTR Engine consumes three input categories:

### **A. Functional Inputs (L1 Layer)**

- project goals and intended outcomes  
- performance and capacity requirements  
- regulatory/permitting boundaries  
- site and environmental context  
- stakeholder expectations  

These define what the project **must achieve**, not how.

---

### **B. Domain Translations (L2 Layer)**

These are structured representations that translate L1 intent into  
machine-readable elements:

- engineering scope tokens  
- preliminary quantities  
- utility and geotechnical constraints  
- permitting requirements  
- buildability indicators  
- sequencing dependencies  

This layer enables deterministic reasoning without losing real-world nuance.

---

### **C. Uncertainty Markers**

Early-stage workflows are dominated by incomplete information.  
The engine explicitly represents uncertainty using:

- missing input flags  
- provisional assumptions  
- value ranges instead of single numbers  
- data confidence levels  

This prevents false precision and supports transparent decision-making.

## 3. Reasoning Patterns

The CTR Engine applies reusable, modular reasoning structures:

### **1. Cost Patterns**

- base structural cost ranges  
- site adaptation & utility impacts  
- compliance overhead (permits, environmental studies, supervision)  
- procurement and contracting model effects  
- risk reserve templates  
- escalation factors  

---

### **2. Schedule Patterns**

- permitting duration structures  
- critical path formation  
- construction sequence templates  
- administrative milestone logic  
- dependency-based propagation rules  

These patterns allow schedule reasoning even with incomplete inputs.

---

### **3. Risk Patterns**

Risk is treated as a **propagating element**, not a final score:

- regulatory & compliance risk  
- geotechnical uncertainty  
- procurement risk (market, contractor availability)  
- sequencing and coordination risk  
- cost/schedule propagation risk  

Risk patterns are reusable across project types.

---

## 4. Output Structure

The CTR Engine produces:

### ✔ structured reasoning chains  
### ✔ cost and schedule envelopes (min–likely–max)  
### ✔ dependency graphs  
### ✔ explicit assumptions  
### ✔ risk maps  
### ✔ required next steps / missing inputs  

These outputs are intended for:

- human decision-makers  
- AI agents  
- early feasibility tools  
- tender-preparation assistance  
- permitting and planning workflows  

The critical value is **traceability**.

---

## 5. Future Development Areas

Potential enhancements include:

- integration with historical cost/schedule datasets  
- probabilistic overlays and Monte Carlo logic  
- live permitting and regulatory data  
- utility and environmental datasets  
- BIM-derived quantity tokenization  
- scenario comparison and multi-option reasoning  

The CTR Engine is the conceptual backbone  
of a transparent, deterministic early-stage decision system.

# Example: Highway Infrastructure (Concept)

Demonstrates how BeeAiBUILD-OS represents
a large-scale linear infrastructure project.

## Intent
Assess early-stage feasibility and constraints for a 12 km mixed-terrain highway section.

## SIM
type: highway section  
length: 12 km  
terrain: mixed (valley + cutting)  
utilities: relocations required  

## Tokens Triggered
ENG.GEOTECH_002  
ENG.CROSS_SLOPE_004  
REG.ENV_IMPACT_005  
PM.CRITICAL_PATH_012  

## Output (CTR Shell – structure only, no calculations)
feasible: CONDITIONAL  
risks: land acquisition, environmental sequencing  
timeline: 32–40 months (banded estimate)  
cost envelope: B3 (high uncertainty)
